# FEND-animal
FEND animal card project is the Udacity Front-End 2nd project utilizing CSS to accomplish the criteria:
Image of favorite animal must be 300px.
The container must be same size with box-sizing property set to initial (conten-box); margin and padding will be added to total dimensions.
It also has a box-shadow property set; custom colors.
I added border top and bottom to the h3 heading.
The "Interesting Fact" text must be italicized.
The main content is in a box with a border. I used border-radius property and an off white background-color.
I used border radius on the image.
